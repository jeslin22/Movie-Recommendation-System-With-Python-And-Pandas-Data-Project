Movie Recommendation System 
 which involves building a system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. Here's a breakdown of the steps and technologies involved:
Steps:
 Data Collection: Gather movie ratings data from users, including movie IDs, user IDs, and ratings.
 
Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, and perform exploratory data analysis.
 
User-Item Matrix: Create a user-item matrix where rows represent users, columns represent movies, and entries represent ratings.
 
Collaborative Filtering: Implement collaborative filtering algorithms like User-Based or Item-Based methods.
 
Model Evaluation: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the recommendation system's accuracy.
 
Top-N Recommendations: Generate top-N movie recommendations for a specific user.
 
Interactive Interface: Create a simple web interface to allow users to input their preferences and receive movie recommendations.
 
 Tech Stack:
 Python: A popular programming language for data science tasks. 
Data manipulation libraries (pandas): Used for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
Recommendation libraries (surprise): Provides implementations of various collaborative filtering algorithms.
Web framework (Flask or Django): For creating the interactive web interface.
Additional Notes:
Collaborative Filtering: This technique is based on the idea that users who have similar tastes in the past are likely to have similar tastes in the future.
User-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends items based on the preferences of similar users.
Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends items based on their similarity to items that the user has liked in the past.
Model Evaluation: Common metrics for evaluating recommendation systems include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Interactive Interface: This allows users to easily interact with the recommendation system and receive personalized recommendations.
